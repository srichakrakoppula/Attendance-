# Attendance-
A web app that connects to our college website and gets attendance info and shows some interesting stuff which students usually need.

Most of the students(like me :p) feel that it is more important to learn and experience programming by yourself than just listening to the theory in every class. I prefer to bunk the classes and do what I wanted to. Sometimes I bunked classes with friends and went out to movies. 

Just as most of the colleges, my college too had attendance rules. My attendance must be greater than 75% at the end of semester.
If my attendance is less than 75% at a point, I used to calculate how many classes I have to attend to reach 75%. Similarly if it is greater than 75%, I calculate how many classes I can bunk and still have 75%. 

I developed this web application for all those students in the college who want to do something out of the box by spending quality time outside college hours. This will help you solve your attendance problems.

P.S.: This app is strictly not for those "Dettol Boys/Girls" who attend every class.
